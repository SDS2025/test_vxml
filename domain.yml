        You enter a grand room lit by flickering torches. A lavish banquet table sits in the center.
        Paintings hang on the east, north, and west walls. There's a bookshelf beside the door you entered,
        and another locked door on the far end of the room, secured with a number padlock.

  utter_table_description:
    - text: >
        The banquet table is ornate, set with silverware and crystal goblets.
        Roasted pheasants and golden apples sit untouched.
        The tablecloth is embroidered with scenes of ancient battles, but nothing unusual stands out.

  utter_painting_east:
    - text: >
        The painting on the east wall shows King Alric in ornate silver armor. Faintly scrawled in the corner: the number 4.

  utter_painting_north:
    - text: >
        Queen Berena in a regal gown, a dagger and scroll in hand. Painted into her necklace: the number 9.

  utter_painting_west:
    - text: >
        Prince Cedric with a falcon on his arm. The number 2 is sewn into the falconâ€™s jess.

  utter_bookshelf:
    - text: >
        There are three books: "Cooking for Nobles", "Legends of the Realm", and "Royal Bloodlines".
        Which do you want to inspect?

  utter_cooking_book:
    - text: >
        A delightful book of feasts and sauces... but nothing helpful.

  utter_legends_book:
    - text: >
        Exciting stories, but no information about your puzzle.

  utter_royal_book:
    - text: >
        It says: King Alric reigned first, then Queen Berena, and finally Prince Cedric.

  utter_memory_empty:
    - text: >
        You don't recall any details yet.

  utter_memory_recall:
    - text: >
        You recall the numbers you've seen:

  utter_code_success:
    - text: >
        You enter the code: 4, 9, 2. The lock beeps and clicks open. The door creaks ajar. Well done, adventurer.

  utter_code_wrong_order:
    - text: >
        These must be the right numbers, but maybe not the right order. Try again.

  utter_code_wrong:
    - text: >
        The lock buzzes angrily. That's not the right code.

  utter_goodbye:
    - text: Goodbye, adventurer.
